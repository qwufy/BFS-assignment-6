The WeightedGraph class represents a weighted graph using an adjacency list. It has methods to add vertices and edges, validate vertices, and retrieve adjacent edges and vertices.
The Edge class represents a weighted edge in the graph. It stores the source, destination, and weight of the edge.
The Vertex class represents a vertex in the graph. It stores the data associated with the vertex and maintains a map of adjacent vertices and their edge weights.
Together, these classes provide a way to create and interact with a weighted graph, allowing for the addition of vertices and edges and retrieval of adjacent vertices and edges.
